## Example Voting App Kubernetes

This is based on the original [example-voting-app](https://github.com/dockersamples/example-voting-app) repository from the [docker-examples](https://github.com/dockersamples) GitHub page

and modified it to work on the Kubernetes cluster for hands-on purpose.

In this project we have used the concept of deployment and services.

Once ready, when we try to execute this on the localhost/ip address it will prompt to ask for the input from the user and save the response into the redis container.
